                        <p>The idea of thrifting has evolved through the years, and in 2020, it holds a much larger meaning than it simply being the quality of using money and resources carefully and not wastefully.
                            However, most of the online thrift stores are run by individuals or a small team of not more than 3-4 persons. It becomes seemingly chaotic, to track orders, bookings and deliveries. Managing inventory and expanding their operations is a difficult task. Since they do not have enough time, technical skill, or resources to invest/ outsource technology to help with their inventory management. 
                            Our project will be focusing on building a user friendly inventory management system, to help such growing businesses.</p><br>
